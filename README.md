# DeepAdmin
Minecraft Plugin in Java for Admins. Includes ban, kick, report, ss, vanish and fly system.
The plugin does not include tempban and mute systems, because this plugin is not completed, and I will not finish it.

This plugin does not include a DataBase System, because I'm working on another plugin inspired on this one, but with more efficient code and better setups.
Only works as of 1.8x in Minecraft Java Edition, requires Spigot 1.8.8 to work.
