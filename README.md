# DeepAdmin
Minecraft Plugin in Java for Admins. Includes ban, kick, mute, report, ss, vanish, fly and tempban system.

This plugin does not include a DataBase System, because I'm working on another plugin inspired on this one, but with more efficient code and better setups.
Only works as of 1.8x in Minecraft Java Edition, requires Spigot 1.8.8 to work.
